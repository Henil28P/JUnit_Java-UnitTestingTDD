# JUnit_Java-UnitTestingTDD
A Java Unit Testing project with JUnit as main unit testing framework for Java. Includes approach to Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Assertions and other key unit testing components on base level of Testing Pyramid.

# JUnit important topics
- Annotations (start with @, source code metadata)
- Best practices - keep it simple, test the actual unit, clear naming and stick to conventions, low-cyclomatic complexity

# Unit testing and other testing types
1. Unit testing
- Testing smallest pieces of the code
- Unit testing alone is not enough to get a grasp of how the system is working and whether it's really behaving as expected.

2. System testing
- Testing a bigger part (eg. the complete API)

3. Integration testing
- Testing different parts and how they work together

4. Acceptance testing
- Where the end-user(s) come in to see whether they are capable of using the software as intended

5. Performance testing
- Testing whether the application is quick enough to load, handle and respond

6. Regression testing
- Testing everything again whenever small changes to code are made to check if the small change didn't throw over any of the existing functionality.

7. Security testing (Penetration testing)
- Testing to spot weaknesses in the security of the system

8. Load testing
- Test to see whether the application can deal with huge loads of traffic at the same time.

9. End-to-end testing (UI testing)
- Testing the application as a whole --> this can be automated with tools such as Selenium and others.
